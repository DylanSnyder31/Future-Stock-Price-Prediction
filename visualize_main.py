'''
Take the values the user inputed, and output the correct grpah

Example:

    python visualize_main.py -APPL -Trained

This would then produce a graph of the APPL stock and the prediction the NN gave, along with the
other data I will include on the UI

* -Untrained will produce the normal graph, without any NN assisstance
* Can do this for every stock, as well as the S&P 500
